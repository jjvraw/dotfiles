Home for some of my config files. This may indefinitely remain as a continuous work in progress.

I switch between MacOS and Ubuntu, aiming for a setup across both systems. 

I use [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/manual/stow.html) to manage these files. I have not done a fresh clone and pull
on either OS in a while, and cannot ensure any dependencies or instructions. With that being said, I have configuration
files for the following:

- [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/)
- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki)
- [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) (Current)
- [Warp](https://www.warp.dev/)
- Z shell
- [Starship](https://starship.rs/)
- Git
