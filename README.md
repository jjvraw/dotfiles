Home for some of my config files. This project is a continuous work in progress and may remain so indefinitely.

I switch between MacOS and Ubuntu, aiming for a seamless setup across both systems. 

I use [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/manual/stow.html) to manage these files. I have not done a fresh clone and pull
in a while on either OS, and cannot ensure any dependencies or instructions. With that being said, I have configuration
files for the following:

- NeoVim
- Tmux
- Alacritty
- Warp
- Z shell
- Starship
- Git
